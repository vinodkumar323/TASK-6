->Project Overview:

The project simulates how a company like Flipkart might track its monthly sales using SQL. It involves a dataset containing order details such as product name, order date, amount, and location.

Using SQL, I grouped and filtered this data to:

Understand how revenue and order volume change month by month

Identify peak sales months

Focus on specific time periods to study patterns

->Dataset Structure

I designed a table called flipkart, which contains the following columns:

order_id – A unique ID for each customer order

customer_name – Name of the person who placed the order

product_name – The item that was ordered

product_id – A unique code representing each product

order_date – The date the order was placed, saved in proper date format

amount – The total value of the order in Indian Rupees

address – The delivery address, covering various cities across India

The sample data includes 25 entries, all generated with realistic but fictional values from different regions in India.
-> Analysis Performed
I used SQL queries to analyze trends such as:

Monthly revenue and how it changes over time

How many orders were placed each month

Which months saw the highest total sales

How to filter and view data for specific time periods like quarters or individual months

This helped me practice SQL techniques such as aggregation (SUM, COUNT), filtering using WHERE, and grouping with GROUP BY.
-> Key Learnings
This project helped me strengthen my skills in:

Writing clean, structured SQL queries

Understanding how to work with date-based data

Performing trend analysis over time using real-world-like datasets

Preparing datasets and query results for documentation and presentation
